Parker and I worked very well together. For the most part, we 
both had flexible schedules and were able to arrange work 
times fairly well. One thing that worked well for us is 
that we were able to help each other quite a bit. 

We ended up basically writing both sorts on our own at the
beginning of the week, and then towards the end of the week
we compared code and merged our ideas. Neither of us had
the sorts completely working, but after bashing heads later
we were able to help peach other debug both sets of code and get
sorts working.
