I pledge that the work done here was my own and that
I have learned how to write this program, such that I 
could throw it out and restart and finish it in
a timely manner. I am not turning in any work that 
I cannot understand, describe, or recreate. I further
acknowledge that I contributed substantially to all
code handed in and vouch for its authenticity.

General Info and Idiosyncrasies
-------------------------------

Styling: 

Both of us prefer the camelCase styling over 
the underscore styling that Professor d St. Germain
recommends. However, we were instructed to not
change the method names that were included in the 
starting "template." 

That being said, all of the code that we wrote was
styled with camelCase, and we just worked around what
was already provided and left it styled with 
underscores.


Note on variable protection:

We believe almost all of our variables in the Sudoku.java class are
either public or protected. We understant that this 
is bad programming practice; however, they were left
this way for testing purposes.

Design Decisions & Features

Our elimination solver only eliminates obvious values,
and does not have any of the extra functionality that
was discussed for extra Karma.
