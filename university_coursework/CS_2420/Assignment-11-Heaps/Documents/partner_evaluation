Homework 11 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Michelle Simmons
Partner: Landon Crowther
Date:    April 13, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 8

Partner Score: 3 - Same

Group Analysis:

Michelle and I worked pretty well together.
We were able to meet up regularly, work 
effectively, and share time well on the computer.

It was easy to work through the methods with her,
as we both had a fairly good understanding of the
code and its properties.
