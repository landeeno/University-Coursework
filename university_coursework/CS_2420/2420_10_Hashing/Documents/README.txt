Project Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this assignment was to create our own custom version
of a HashTable. Our implementation contained almost all of the same
methods as Java's HashTable does. By creating it on our own, we were
able to write algorithms to know HOW the methods work, rather than
just what they do. 

We made a Pair class, that simply allowed us to store generic type 
data in a Key, Value combination. This Pair was used as the backing
for all of the data that was used in the assignment.

Notes to TA
---------------------------------------------------------------

The figures that are required in the assignment description are 
in the “Documents” folder, however they are saved as .pdf files, 
rather than .ps files. I am unsure what a .ps file is, 
or how to generate it. 

Both partners prefer camelCase styling over snake_case styling.
That being said, all of our code was written with camelCase, and
we left the original code as is.

Pledge
---------------------------------------------------------------

I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have 
learned how to write this program (such that I could throw 
it out and restart and finish it in a timely manner).  
I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, 
describe, or recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other
than the lecture that I used to help write the code are cited 
in my work.  When working with a partner, I have contributed
an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  
Further, I have helped write all the code assigned as 
pair-programming and reviewed all code that was written separately.

Design Decisions
---------------------------------------------------------------

For the most part, there are no significant design decisions that
were made. We followed each method description pretty closely, 
and everything works (to the best of my knowledge) correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Encountered & Solutions
---------------------------------------------------------------

For the most part, there were little to no problems during this
assignment. We just took each problem one step at a time, and by
having the end goal in mind, were able to make smart design decisions
that enabled us to solve the problems in this assignment.
