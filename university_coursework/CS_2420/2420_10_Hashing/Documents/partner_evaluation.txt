Homework 10 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Landon Crowther
Date:    Apr. 07, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 8

Partner Score: 3 

Group Analysis:  

Nathan and I were able to work very quickly and efficiently on this project. 
We were very good at taking turns writing code, as to make sure
that we both could talk through the methods and logic involved.

Fortunately, this assignment did not take too long, and we could 
finish in a timely manner without too much trouble. Nathan and I have
worked together in the past, and fortunately were able to work
together again. Our schedules matched up pretty well, and we were
very consistent at making progress throughout the assignment.
