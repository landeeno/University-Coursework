Pledge
------------------------------

I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write this program, 
such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely manner. I am not turning 
in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or recreate. I further acknowledge that I 
contributed substantially to all code handed in and vouch for it's authenticity.

General Info & Idiosyncrasies
------------------------------

The helper method stringToCharacter is not actually tested in the AnagramUtilTest class, 
because it is indirectly tested when the sort method is tested. 


We converted everything to lowercase in both the sort() method and the
getLargestAnagramGroup() method. This was necessary because not all of the
words in the words_english file were lowercase


For timing, we made a separate class that automates the timing process
for all the methods stated in the assignment description. The user just
has to run the code and give the computer sufficient time to run, and the 
console will produce clearly labeled values that can be copied and pasted
into a graphing program.

------------------------------
Design Decisions & Features
------------------------------

We utilized the generic method insertionSort() when we 
created the sort() method. Instead of making a new sort which follows
the same insertionSort logic, we converted the String parameter to a
Character[] array, and utilized the insertionSort method to re-arrange
the characters in alphabetical order. (also in Javadoc)
