Homework 4 - Partner Declaration
My Name: Parker Stewart
Partner: Landon Crowther
Date:    Feb 9, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 10 hours

Partner Score: # - Parter did 3

Landon and I were able to spend about 90% of the total work time on this project working together. A few times 
one of us would get an idea on how to do something while we were already home and would update the code
and then inform our partner the following day. Overall Landon and I were an effective team because we were able 
to bounce ideas off of each other. Landon also had a stronger grasp on the sorting methods, which he helped 
educate me as we went. I was able to get a good understanding of reading in a file and the comparator, so I could 
implement that part of our code and educate Landon on it. Our partnership has been an effective on and this assingment
was completed because of that.
