Homework 6 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Landon Crowther
Date:    Mar. 30, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 6

Partner Score: 3. 

Group Analysis:  

Nathan and I were able to work very quickly and efficiently on this project. 
We were very good at taking turns writing code, as to make sure
that we both could talk through the methods and logic invovled.

Fortunately, this assignment did not take too long, and we could 
finish in a timely manner without too much trouble. Nathan was
a great partner and I wouldn't mind working with him
again in the future.
