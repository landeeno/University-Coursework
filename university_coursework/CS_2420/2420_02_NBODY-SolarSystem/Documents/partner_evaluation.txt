Homework 2 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Landon Crowther
Partner: Brent Collins
Date:    Jan. 26, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 15-20 hours

Partner Score: #3 (Maybe 3.5 ish)

--Partner Did--
My partner and I seemed to work very well together. By the 
time we met up, we both had a pretty solid foundation on
the project, and were at about the same point as far as progress
goes. 

The two of us spent quite a few hours in the CADE lab working on the
project, and that's where the majority of the work came from. We both 
took a method one step at a time, and were both trying on our own computers
and talking each other through our thought process. We would also 
periodically stop working to write out the steps required for certain methods.

At the end of the day, we were pretty stuck and decided to call it a day.
I woke up to an email saying he went home and was able to get the 
simulation working, which I was stoked about. We continued to work on 
the project, and eventually finished it.

I gave my partner a 3.5 score, because although we did the majority of the
work together, there were a few things he spent a good chunk of time on. 
Likewise, there were other things I spent time on, but I want to give credit
where credit is due. 

Group Analysis:  

Our group worked/didn't work because.....
----------------------------------

Our group worked out pretty well because we were both very ambitious
to complete the project to the fulllest extent. We also were able to 
spend 4-6 hours together in the CADE lab, and in that time we got the
majority of the project learned. Each time one of us figured out how
to correctly implement a method, we would stop and teach the other 
person. This helped solidify the knowledge and ultimately better our skills.
