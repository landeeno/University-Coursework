I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write this program, 
such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely manner. 
I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or recreate. 
I further acknowledge that I contributed substantially to all code handed in and vouch for its authenticity.

-------------------------------
General Info and Idiosyncrasies
-------------------------------

This program should work the way described in the assignment outline.
The only thing that may be different is we used one constructor in the 
Satellite class and just modified the constructor calls in the Star_Field
class. 

---------------------------
Design Decisions & Features
---------------------------

We only made a couple methods in Satellite abstract because
we felt, for the most part, the methods applied the same to the
subclasses.
If you click on a sun it will go super nova, very briefly
enlarge then explode, leaving flotsam. If you click on a
planet it will explode too. Strangely this exploding feature
causes the planets and star to shoot around. However, the core
functionality described is there.
