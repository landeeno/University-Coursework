Homework 5 - Partner Declaration
My Name: Landon Crowther
Partner: Brent Collins
Date:    Feb 23, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 18 hours

Partner Score: 3

Brent and I worked very well together, and were
able to effectively bounce ideas off eachother. However,
our schedules didn't match up very well this time.

We both ended up having to do a good chunk of work
remotely, and collaborating via phone or email.

Next assignment I am going to find a partner that 
has a more similar schedule.
