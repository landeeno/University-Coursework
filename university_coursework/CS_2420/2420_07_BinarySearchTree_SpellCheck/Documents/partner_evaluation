Homework 7 - Partner Declaration
My Name: Landon Crowther
Partner: Dezeray Kowalski
Date:    Mar. 02, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 15 hours

Partner Score: 4

My partner was awesome! Unfortunately I was
super busy this week (3 jobs will do that
to ya...). However, she was able to meet up
with my around my schedule, which I really
appreciated. 

I gave Dezeray a 4 because I felt like 
she went out of her way to make sure that
we had the best submission possible. After
we would finish working together, she would
often go home and continue to work on the 
project or tidy up the code.

Although we spent the majority of the time
working together on the project, I know she
was able to put a bit more time in than I 
was and it helped out a lot, especially 
towards the end of the assignment.
