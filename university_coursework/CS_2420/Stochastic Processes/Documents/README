Project Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------
This project used poker (5-card and texas hold em) to explore
the concept of stochastic analysis. We simulated a variety of poker
hands, and ranked them by the rules of poker. We then computed the
percentages that these hands occurred, and compared them to the 
mathematical percentage (exhaustive computation - the odds that a
certain hand can happen out of all possible hands).

As the amount of samples increased, it was noted that the difference
between the stochastic results and exhaustive results decreased to 
where there was a negligible difference.

Pledge
---------------------------------------------------------------

I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have 
learned how to write this program (such that I could throw 
it out and restart and finish it in a timely manner).  
I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, 
describe, or recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other
than the lecture that I used to help write the code are cited 
in my work.  When working with a partner, I have contributed
an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  
Further, I have helped write all the code assigned as 
pair-programming and reviewed all code that was written separately.

Design Decisions
---------------------------------------------------------------
We used enum classes for the suits and the ranks of the cards
and used the ordinals of those enum values to help us compute
the hand ranks.

One of the methods that ended up being quite complicated 
was the texas hold em analysis. Because this method had to compare
every possible two-card combination to every other possible two card
combination, we had to utilize a key value data structure where the
key represented a "map" that refernced which start hand was stored, and 
the value represented the "score" it got when compared to every other class
(see Timing_Accuracy and javadoc for more details)

Problems Encountered & Solutions
---------------------------------------------------------------
Overall our main issue throughout the assignment was understanding
what exactly the directions were asking for, and then figuring out
the best way to execute the code. Once we had an idea of how we 
were going to design the methods, the assignment was fairly straight
forward. We ran into a few issues when we would forget tiny parts 
of code and then spend a long time trying to find the bug.
