Homework 8 - Partner Declaration
My Name: Landon Crowther
Partner: Parker Stewart
Date:    March 23, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 14 hours

Partner Score: 3

Parker and I have worked together in the past, and seem to work very well together. One thing that I 
noticed about our partnership is differences in coding styles. Parker likes to make each line of code
represent one step in a process, and I have a tendency to try and consolodate. Although the differences
are negligible at runtime, it can be frustrating when we're both working on the same method and
have different ways to write the methods out. 

Other than that, we were able to keep a good pace throughout the assignment, and meet fairly regularly.
It was nice to have someone to double check ideas with, and to help come over potential brain-barriers.

Although I have worked with Parker in the past, I will have worked with over four partners by
the end of the semester.
