Homework 12 - Partner Declaration
My Name: Brent Collins
Partner: Landon Crowther
Date:    Apr 25, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 20 hours

Partner Score: 3

Brent and I were able to finish the code in a timely 
and efficient manner. It is worth noting, however,
that I had a few issues with my orignal partner.
These issues are explained in the beginning
of my analysis document. 

Brent and I have worked together in the past,
and both of us had a good understanding of the
assignment requirements / methodology.
